# Deep-Q-learning-for-mobile-edge-computing

More details can be found at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9253665

To run the code, please install tensorflow 1.4.0. File train.py is the main code. File fog_env.py contains the code for mobile edge computing environment. File RL_brain.py contains the code for deep reinforcement learning.

If you use this code for research, please cite the following paper:
Ming Tang and Vincent W.S. Wong, “Deep Reinforcement Learning for Task Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing Systems,” IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, 2020 (Early Access).

# Simulation Code for Results Regeneration
I have added some code for simulation and regenerating the results reported in the above mentioned paper.
I needed the results as part of my work on DRL-based solutions for task offloading in MEC systems which is the focus of my undergraduate Final project.
I hope this code helps someone who also needs simulation codes for regenerating results in the aforementioned paper.
If you see any problem in my code, I'd be happy to be notified about it.
